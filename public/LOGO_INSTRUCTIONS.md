# IMPORTANT: Logo File Placement

## To make your SATYAH logo visible:

1. **Place your logo file** in this `public` folder
2. **Name it exactly:** `logo.png`
3. **File should be:** PNG format with transparent background

## File Path:
```
/public/logo.png
```

## After placing the file:
- The logo will automatically appear in:
  - Navigation bar (top-left)
  - Hero section (centered)
  - Footer
  - Mobile menu

## Supported formats:
- PNG (recommended - with transparency)
- SVG (also works)
- JPG (works but no transparency)

## If using a different format:
If your logo is not PNG, you can:
1. Rename it to match: `logo.png`, `logo.svg`, or `logo.jpg`
2. Update `src/components/Logo.jsx` line 15 to use the correct extension

## Current Status:
⚠️ Logo file not found - please add `logo.png` to this folder
